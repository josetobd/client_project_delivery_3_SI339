Hi, here is Jos√©. This is my development for the Client Project Deliverable for the SI 339 subject. 

I have done a website with: 
- Homepage explaining what it is all about.
- Men's team page.
- Women's team page.
- A page for each athlete.

-You can access to any of these three pages with the sticky navbar.
- In both team pages, you can click on any of all the athletes in the database. 

I hope you enjoy it. It is done primary for mobile devices, I strongly recommend to use for instance the Iphone 14 view.

I have included diverse innovative things such as animations (for instance fade ins), dark theme, the super useful, sticky navbar and I pass the axe colour validator since I used a colour palette which avoid color contrast problems.
